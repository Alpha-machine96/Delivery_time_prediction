## Overview

This project tackles the challenge of accurately predicting food delivery times by leveraging machine learning algorithms. By analyzing factors such as distance, traffic conditions, weather, delivery person characteristics, and time patterns, the model provides reliable time estimates that can enhance both customer experience and business operations.

### Why This Matters

- **Customer Satisfaction:** Accurate delivery time estimates improve user experience

- **Operational Efficiency:** Better resource allocation and route planning

- **Business Intelligence:** Identify factors that impact delivery performance

### Project Highlights

- **Dataset:** 45,000+ delivery records from Kaggle

- **Models:** Compared Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest

- **Best Model:** Random Forest Regressor (tuned with GridSearchCV)

- **Performance:** R² = 0.84, MAE = ±6.5 minutes
